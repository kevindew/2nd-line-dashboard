# ðŸš§WIP 2nd Line DashboardðŸš§

This is a dashboard for use by GOV.UK to monitor 2nd Line. It's built using
[create-react-app][]. It's just something I've been playing around with (with
some very rusty CSS, React and Redux knowledge) hopefully will form into
something proper.

A build of the master branch is available at:
https://kevindew.github.io/2nd-line-dashboard/ but this isn't usable outside of
GDS network.

## Dependencies
